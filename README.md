# Welcome to my Data Science Portifolio

This portfolio is a compilation of data science projects which I created for exploration of machine learning algorithms, also for data analysis, presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.  

## Classification problems

### [Credit Card fraud detection](https://github.com/PedroOrona/pedroorona.github.io/blob/master/Fraud%20Detection.ipynb):

  - Dataset provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).
  - Visualization and preparation of the data itself.
  - Model using SMOTE and Random Forest.
  
### [Hand Writting Digits recognition](https://github.com/PedroOrona/pedroorona.github.io/blob/master/MNIST.ipynb)

  -  Evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on 28 x 28 pixel images.
  - Visualization e exploration of the data set.
  - Comparison of different algorithms performance.
